# üß† AgenticFlow: Strategic AI Agent Framework

---

## üîÑ Overview

**AgenticFlow** is a strategic AI agent framework capable of executing complex workflows using both symbolic and learned planning techniques.

* A **dynamic agent workflow** enables flexible decision-making.
* Each **context or step** behaves like an object in OOP, with defined **inputs, prompts, tools, and outputs**.
* A **workflow** is structured as a **chain, tree, or graph** of these contexts or steps.
* The **LLM** receives user requests and routes them to the **action model**.
* A **UI interface** allows users to design specific workflow applications via a UI, which are then passed to the action model.
* The **action model** uses the provided request and workflow to determine the optimal response using strategic planning methods‚Äîsuch as **Depth-First Search**, **Breadth-First Search**, **Monte Carlo Tree Search**, or other appropriate algorithms.
* These strategies can be **trained into the model** to improve performance over time.

This enables the development of flexible, extensible, and trainable agent-based applications with robust planning and reasoning capabilities.

| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic agent workflows as graphs**                    | LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI         | Similar in enabling DAG-based agent behavior.                 |
| **Context/Step as OOP-like unit (input, tools, output)** | LangChain Runnable, LangGraph Node | Aligns with LangChain‚Äôs modular `Runnable` abstraction.       |
| **Workflow built via UI and executed by model**          | MetaGPT, SuperAGI, Smol-dev        | Indirect overlap; UI-based orchestration is rare.             |
| **Strategy-based traversal (DFS, MCTS, etc.)**           | Agent-Q                            |                                                               |
| **Training strategy models**                             | Unity ML-Agents (in robotics)      | LLM frameworks don‚Äôt typically include trainable planners.    |
