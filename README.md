# üß† AgenticFlow: Strategic AI Agent Framework

---

## üîÑ Overview

**AgenticFlow** is a strategic AI agent framework capable of executing complex workflows using both symbolic and learned planning techniques.

* A **dynamic agent workflow** enables flexible decision-making.
* Each **context or step** behaves like an object in OOP, with defined **inputs, prompts, tools, and outputs**.
* A **workflow** is structured as a **chain, tree, or graph** of these contexts or steps.
* The **LLM** receives user requests and routes them to the **action model**.
* A **builder interface** allows users to design specific workflow applications via a UI, which are then passed to the action model.
* The **action model** uses the provided request and workflow to determine the optimal response using strategic planning methods‚Äîsuch as **Depth-First Search**, **Breadth-First Search**, **Monte Carlo Tree Search**, or other appropriate algorithms.
* These strategies can be **trained into the model** to improve performance over time.

### Key Features

- A modular, graph-based execution engine.
- An intelligent **action model** that selects the best traversal strategy (e.g., DFS, BFS, MCTS).
- A **Builder UI** for visually constructing agent workflows.
- Support for **training models** to dynamically select or blend traversal strategies based on context.

This enables the development of flexible, extensible, and trainable agent-based applications with robust planning and reasoning capabilities.

| Feature / Concept                                        | Overlap With                       | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dynamic agent workflows as graphs**                    | LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI         | Similar in enabling DAG-based agent behavior.                 |
| **Context/Step as OOP-like unit (input, tools, output)** | LangChain Runnable, LangGraph Node | Aligns with LangChain‚Äôs modular `Runnable` abstraction.       |
| **Workflow built via UI and executed by model**          | MetaGPT, SuperAGI, Smol-dev        | Indirect overlap; UI-based orchestration is rare.             |
| **Strategy-based traversal (DFS, MCTS, etc.)**           | None                               | Original idea; not found in other agent frameworks.           |
| **Training strategy models**                             | Unity ML-Agents (in robotics)      | LLM frameworks don‚Äôt typically include trainable planners.    |

## üß† What Makes AgenticFlow Unique

1. **Graph Traversal as a Reasoning Strategy**  
   Workflows are searched using symbolic algorithms (DFS, BFS, MCTS), enabling adaptive and optimal decision-making.

2. **Trainable Planner / Strategy Selector**  
   The system can learn which traversal strategy fits a given workflow, blending classical search with ML or RL policy optimization.

3. **Visual Builder to Runtime Execution Flow**  
   A full-stack connection from a visual workflow designer to an action model that interprets and executes plans dynamically.

4. **Modular Step Architecture**  
   Each step is encapsulated like a class with inputs, prompts, tools, and outputs ‚Äî making the system reusable and composable.
